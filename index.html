            <p>Shueisha has officially announced that new chapters will be released starting October 7, 2024.</p>

            <p>The news of new chapters coincides with the release of volume 38 on September 4, 2024, which compiled previously serialized chapters into a single volume for the first time.</p>
            
            <p> Shueisha confirmed that Hunter x Hunter will not return with a weekly release schedule.</p>
